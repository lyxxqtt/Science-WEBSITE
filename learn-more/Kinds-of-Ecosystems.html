    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="article-text">
      <p>Ecosystems are natural systems where living organisms such as plants, animals, and microorganisms interact with each other and with non-living components like soil, water, and air. These interactions form a complex and balanced web of life that supports biodiversity and sustains natural processes. Ecosystems can be broadly classified into two main types: terrestrial ecosystems and aquatic ecosystems.</p>
      <p>Terrestrial ecosystems are found on land and include environments such as forests, deserts, and grasslands. These ecosystems vary greatly depending on climate, soil type, and geographical location. For example, forests are rich in plant and animal species and are characterized by dense vegetation, while deserts are dry, arid regions with sparse vegetation and specially adapted wildlife. Grasslands, on the other hand, are dominated by grasses and provide habitats for large herbivores and their predators.</p>
      <p>Aquatic ecosystems exist in water and are further divided into two main subtypes: marine and freshwater ecosystems. Marine ecosystems cover about 71% of the Earth's surface and include oceans, coral reefs, estuaries, and deep-sea environments. They are characterized by high levels of salt and are home to diverse marine life such as fish, whales, corals, plankton, and algae. Freshwater ecosystems, which include rivers, lakes, ponds, streams, and wetlands, contain very low salt concentrations and make up only a small fraction of the Earth's surface. Despite their limited size, freshwater ecosystems support a wide variety of organisms, including fish, amphibians, aquatic plants, insects, and birds.</p>
      <p>Each type of ecosystem plays a crucial role in maintaining the Earth's natural balance by regulating climate, recycling nutrients, purifying water, and supporting life. Understanding the different kinds of ecosystems helps us appreciate the importance of conservation and sustainable living.</p>
      <p>Another important aspect of ecosystems is their role in providing ecosystem services ‚Äî the benefits that humans receive from nature. These services include the purification of air and water, pollination of crops, climate regulation, and nutrient cycling. For example, wetlands filter pollutants from water, forests absorb carbon dioxide, and bees pollinate flowers and food crops. These functions are essential for human survival and well-being, even if we don‚Äôt always notice them in our daily lives.</p>
      <p>Human activities such as deforestation, pollution, climate change, and overfishing are putting many ecosystems at risk. When an ecosystem becomes unbalanced or is destroyed, it can lead to the loss of species and resources we depend on. Therefore, it is important to protect and conserve ecosystems through sustainable practices, education, and responsible use of natural resources. By maintaining the health of ecosystems, we help ensure a better future for all life on Earth.</p>

    <div class="article-text">
      <p>Terrestrial ecosystems are land-based ecosystems where organisms interact with the soil, air, and climate. They vary depending on geographic location, altitude, temperature, and rainfall.</p>
      <p>Terrestrial ecosystems include forests, deserts, and grasslands. Forest ecosystems are among the most biodiverse environments on Earth, providing habitats for a vast array of species. </p>
      <p>Tropical rainforests, found near the equator, receive high rainfall throughout the year and feature dense canopies of tall trees, rich undergrowth, and species like jaguars, parrots, and countless insects.</p>
      <p>Temperate forests, located in regions with four distinct seasons, include both deciduous forests‚Äîwhere trees such as oaks and maples shed their leaves annually‚Äîand evergreen coniferous forests, which are dominated by pines and spruces that retain their needle-like leaves all year. These forests support a variety of mammals, birds, and insects adapted to changing seasons.</p>

    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="article-text">
      <p>Desert ecosystems are defined by extremely low rainfall and can be either hot or cold. Hot deserts, such as the Sahara, are characterized by intense heat during the day and cold temperatures at night. </p>
      <p>Plants like cacti and succulents store water efficiently, while animals such as snakes, lizards, and camels have developed ways to survive in harsh, arid conditions.</p>
      <p>Cold deserts, such as those in Antarctica, experience freezing temperatures most of the year. While they appear barren, cold deserts still support life forms such as mosses, lichens, and cold-adapted animals like penguins in coastal zones.</p>
      <p>Desert ecosystems, whether hot or cold, are fragile and highly sensitive to changes in temperature and water availability. Despite their seemingly lifeless appearance, they are home to unique and well-adapted organisms and play a vital role in global ecological balance.</p>
      <p>Their landscapes store geological history, and their climate conditions influence surrounding regions. However, due to climate change and human activities such as overgrazing, mining, and urban expansion, many desert ecosystems are under threat. </p>
      <p>Protecting these environments ensures the survival of specialized species and helps maintain Earth's overall biodiversity.</p>

      <h2 class="hover-line">üçÉ Grassland ecosystems</h2>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="article-text">
      <p>Grassland ecosystems are vast, open landscapes dominated primarily by grasses and herbaceous (non-woody) plants, with very few trees or large shrubs. These ecosystems typically form in regions where there is not enough consistent rainfall to support forests, but too much moisture for deserts to develop.</p>
      <p>Grasslands are known for their wide horizons, fertile soil, and seasonal climate patterns. There are two major types of grasslands: tropical grasslands, also known as savannas, and temperate grasslands, often referred to as prairies or steppes depending on the region.</p>
      <p>Savannas are typically found near the equator in regions such as Africa, South America, and Australia, where there is a distinct wet and dry season. These areas are home to some of the most iconic and diverse wildlife on the planet. Large herbivores like elephants, giraffes, zebras, and antelopes graze across the landscape, while powerful predators such as lions, cheetahs, and hyenas depend on these herbivores for food.</p>
      <p>Scattered trees, like acacias and baobabs, dot the savanna and provide limited shade and nesting places for birds and mammals. The ecological interactions between predator and prey, as well as between grazing animals and plant life, make savannas rich in biodiversity and essential for studying natural food chains.</p>
      <p>Temperate grasslands are found in regions with more moderate climates, such as the Great Plains of North America, the pampas of South America, and the steppes of Central Asia and Eastern Europe. These grasslands experience four distinct seasons, including cold winters and warm summers. The vegetation is mainly composed of tough, drought-resistant grasses like buffalo grass or ryegrass, with very few trees due to recurring fires and grazing pressure.</p>
      <p>These ecosystems support animals like bison, prairie dogs, antelope, and predators such as wolves and foxes. The rich, deep topsoil in these areas‚Äîformed by the decomposition of grass roots over centuries‚Äîmakes temperate grasslands some of the most agriculturally productive areas in the world. As a result, many grasslands have been converted into farmland for growing crops like wheat, corn, and barley.</p>

    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="article-text">
      <p>Marine ecosystems are vast water-based environments that include oceans, seas, coral reefs, and estuaries. Covering over 70% of the Earth‚Äôs surface, they are the largest and most diverse ecosystems on the planet. These ecosystems are crucial not only for their biodiversity but also for their role in climate regulation, oxygen production, and carbon storage. </p>
      <p>Marine ecosystems help absorb vast amounts of carbon dioxide and produce over half of the world‚Äôs oxygen through the activity of phytoplankton, tiny plant-like organisms that float in the ocean‚Äôs surface waters. The ocean‚Äôs currents also help regulate global temperatures and influence weather patterns around the world.</p>
      <p>The open ocean, or pelagic zone, is home to a variety of marine species ranging from microscopic plankton to the largest animals on Earth, like blue whales. Marine animals such as dolphins, sharks, jellyfish, turtles, and schools of fish inhabit different ocean layers, depending on depth, temperature, and light availability. Some species, like deep-sea fish and giant squids, thrive in total darkness in the deepest parts of the ocean where pressures are extreme and sunlight never reaches. Despite its vastness, much of the ocean remains unexplored, and scientists continue to discover new marine species and ecosystems</p>
      <p>Freshwater ecosystems consist of bodies of water with low salt concentrations, such as rivers, lakes, ponds, and wetlands. These ecosystems are smaller in surface area compared to marine ecosystems but are equally important.</p>
      <p>Lentic ecosystems (still waters like lakes and ponds) provide habitats for amphibians, fish, aquatic plants, and insects. Lotic ecosystems (flowing waters like rivers and streams) support species adapted to moving water, including migratory fish and riverbank vegetation. Wetlands, which include swamps and marshes, are among the most productive ecosystems on Earth. They act as natural filters for pollutants, help control floods, and support a rich diversity of life including birds, amphibians, and unique aquatic plants.</p>
